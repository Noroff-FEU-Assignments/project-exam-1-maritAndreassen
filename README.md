The project goal was to put into practice the skills I have learned over my first year of studies at Noroff.

## Description

The project is a blog that contains several pages. It is build with HTML, CSS and JavaScript only, and is formed by certain requirements given in the assignment.
I have chosen design and theme my self.The content for my website had to be stored on a WordPress installation used as a Headless CMS, so most of the content and images are stored there. Not all features is working, like links to social media in the footer.

Outgoing is the name of the blog and the logo up in the left corner sends you to the home page. There you have a introduction to the page, a carusel with the lastest posts and a motivation image at the bottom. Latest post are clickable and sends you to the specific page for that post. I have also a page for all the blogs, where you can move on to each post by a view-button, a page about me and contact.
